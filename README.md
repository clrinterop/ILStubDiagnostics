# ILStubDiagnostics - clrinterop

> The **IL Stub Diagnostic Tool** enables real-time inspection of the contents of IL stubs.

One of the problems with the old 32 bit marshaling infrastructure was that it worked essentially
as a black box that was very difficult to debug if something went wrong.
The IL Stubs Diagnostic Tool provides a window into what used to be a black box and allows you
to look into the very core of interop marshaling â€“ the IL Stub itself.
