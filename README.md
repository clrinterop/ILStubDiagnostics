# ILStubDiagnostics - clrinterop

> The **IL Stub Diagnostic Tool** enables real-time inspection of the contents of IL stubs.

One of the problems with the old 32 bit marshaling infrastructure was that it worked essentially
as a black box that was very difficult to debug if something went wrong.
The IL Stubs Diagnostic Tool provides a window into what used to be a black box and allows you
to look into the very core of interop marshaling â€“ the IL Stub itself.


## Project Description

IL stubs are dynamically generated on the fly by the CLR and handle the marshalling and
invocation of the target method. The IL Stub Diagnostic tool was created to ease the
interop debugging experience. It is a real-time monitor which shows the details of every
IL stub generated by the CLR in a given process. For each stub, the tool currently displays
its IL code as well as the signature of the managed/native methods.
